To Do:

1. Make the panel a unlimited-sized map, and add move, zoom-in, zoom-out features.
   a. briefly works now. Jump to 2.
   b. small bugs - 
       i. "move" hand still show up when click on zoom in
       ii. expanding the canvas seems too aggressive.
       iii. zoom in/out slow.
2. Add arrow connection feature to the nodes.
   v. waiting for validation. 
3. Add recursive highlight based on the arrow connections.
4. Add more labels to the nodes.
5. Add a feature to highlight by the labels.
6. Design a file for saving and loading the diagram info.
