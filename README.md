To Do:

1. Make the panel a unlimited-sized map, and add move, zoom-in, zoom-out features.
   a. briefly works now. Jump to 2.
   b. small bugs - 
       i. "move" hand still show up when click on zoom in
       ii. expanding the canvas seems too aggressive.
       iii. zoom in/out slow.
2. Add arrow connection feature to the nodes. Validated:
   a. no unselect functionality / handlers. (added)
        ?. cannot exit the edit mode (fixed)
           huh??. cannot enter the edit mode by double clicking  (fixed)
   b. flow connection wasn't enabled - hard stop. (fixed) 
   c. I cannot see the arrow head - caught issue - it is connected to the center lol ..... my bad (fixed)
       um. optimize - the arrow is not perfect yet .... when to the left, up, down 
   d. if flow connected no need to have another (small)
   e. hard to select the arrow - it could be bolder (bolded)
2 1/2. Fixed the evil bug : when going to border it expands infinitely  (fixed)
3. Add recursive highlight based on the arrow connections. - DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!DAG!
4. Add more labels to the nodes.
5. Add a feature to highlight by the labels.
6. Design a file for saving and loading the diagram info.
